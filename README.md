# 💼🔎 JobSeeker Project
## About
It might be difficult for job seekers to locate jobs that match their goals and skill set in the modern workforce. There are many tools and platforms available to help job seekers in their pursuit of work, and the labor market is competitive and dynamic.

## Problem Statement 
JobSeeker student-company matching algorithm faces challenges related to student engagement, shortlisting biases based on school or program, and factors influencing student approval rates such as email engagement and CV uploads. 
These issues impact overall job placement success rates and need to be addressed to optimize the matching process and enhance student opportunities.

## 👩🏻‍💻 Tech Stack
* PowerBI
* BigQuery
* Notion

## 🔬 Hypotheses
* Analyzing conversion rates for students: There might be a significant drop-off in conversion rates between status update for opt-in students
* CV upload influence on approved students: Students with completed CV uploads might have a higher likelihood of being  approved by recruiters
* Analyzing of Approved Students by Schools: Certain schools or programs may have higher shortlisting rates compared to others, suggesting biases in the matching algorithm or recruiter preferences.
* Analyzing of Approved Students by Country: Certain schools or programs may have higher shortlisting rates compared to others, suggesting biases in the matching algorithm or recruiter preferences.
